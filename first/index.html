    <p> Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) is a tabletop roleplaying adventure game. It has spiked in popularity in recent years
        due to exposure from series like Critical Roll, or High Rollers, and the perspective on it has changed from a 
        rather niche pastime to a versatile tool for people to tell a story and entertain themselves</p>

    <p> Although the player groups can vary widely in size, it is generally advised to form a group of 3 to 7 players,
        along with a DM. These are the things you will need to get started: </p>

    <ol>
      <li> A Character Sheet </li>
      <li> A tabletop (or a platform like Roll20) </li>
      <li> Imagination and Inspiration, especially if you're the DM</li>
    </ol>

   <p> You can find the basic rules for 5e of DnD <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules"> HERE </a>.
       You don't need anything more than what you use to view this page in order to start, so do yourself a favor and get started! </p>
